# Fake News Classification

This project aims to classify news articles as either real or fake using the Multinomial Naive Bayes model. The model has achieved a classification accuracy of 90% using bag of words and one hot encoder techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a collection of news articles obtained from various sources. The dataset contains a total of 10,000 news articles, out of which 5,000 are real news articles and the other 5,000 are fake news articles.

## Preprocessing

The first step in the preprocessing stage was to clean the text data by removing any unnecessary characters and symbols. The text was then tokenized into words and transformed into a bag of words representation. One hot encoder was also used to represent the text data in binary form.

## Model

The Multinomial Naive Bayes model was used for classification, which is a probabilistic algorithm that works by calculating the probability of each feature in the data belonging to a particular class. The model was trained on the preprocessed data and achieved an accuracy of 90%.

## Results

The results of the model show that it is able to classify news articles with a high level of accuracy, which is promising for future applications in the field of fake news detection.

## Future Work

In the future, more advanced techniques such as deep learning algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be explored to improve the accuracy of the model. Additionally, the model can be trained on larger datasets to make it more robust and applicable in real-world scenarios.
